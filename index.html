        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="wrapper-2">
          <p>I am a Bay Area native who graduated from UC Davis with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology in March of 2021. However, I did not see myself pursuing a career path in the field, so I found myself a job as an afterschool Math and English elementary and middle school teacher to make ends meet. In the meantime, I also picked up multiple hobbies hoping to find some inspiration in what my endgame career would look like. Programming was one of the hobbies I picked up, and I knew this was the career path I wanted to traverse the moment I started typing my first code.</p>
          <p>I dabbled in Codecademy and taught myself the basics of Python and JavaScript through their website. Thoroughly enjoying the learning process, I decided I wanted to join a coding boot camp to expedite my development as a programmer. I initially was going to attend App Academy after contemplating my options, and I was a few days from starting my first day of class with them after completing all of their prep-work (which significantly helped my understanding of web development), but I stumbled upon a review on Rithm School and saw that they were the better fit for me. I retracted my admission and self-taught myself more web development with the incorporation of back-end development through a Udemy course as I waited for an opportunity to join the next cohort for Rithm School.</p>
          <p>Through Rithm School, I had plenty of practice with JavaScript problem solving, which I absolutely loved as it gave me similar experiences with my past as a competitive chess player. I found myself solving problems on LeetCode and Codewars during my free time to help develop my pattern recognition for certain types of problems.</p>
          <p>I am now an upcoming Rithm School student and will be a part of their r28 cohort.</p>
