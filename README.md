Requirements

You can design this as a multi-page site or a single-page site, depending on what you’d like. You must build this yourself; you may not use a canned site-builder (like Wix or Squarespace).

At a minimum, it should have the following:

Some kind of navigation (a navbar at the top, for example). In a multi-page site, this should link to the other pages; on a single-page site, this should take the user to the different headings.

At least three pages or sections:

1. Landing area/top area with a photo
2. About you (including a PDF of your most current resume)
3. Contact information

Styling. You can either do this by writing CSS yourself or by using a CSS framework, like Bootstrap. You don’t need to have a complex or extremely-polished visual design, but you do need to make things look a bit stylized.
